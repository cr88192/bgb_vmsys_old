I am mostly trying to get some old projects of mine uploaded, mostly from my high-school era. I was young once, and I figured I may as well put some of this online.

I don't expect any of this will be all that useful, but I started feeling tempoarily nostalgic.

vmsys: Was some combination of a Scheme VM and GUI.
os1_7: Was an early attempt of mine at implementing an OS.

IIRC, the OS project was (for me) mostly middle-school era but carried over into high-school.

The Scheme VM was overlapping in terms of timeframe and code, but was partly its own thing (this is more high-school era from what I remember). Much of this was written between the late 1990s and early 2000s.
