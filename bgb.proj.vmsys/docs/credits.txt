I will try to note some places where I had gotten source/data/... (I am not
terribly great at keeping track of this).

gazos, linux, quake, crystal space, and a few others had offered some
code/data (I was careful to avoid using any known copyrighted data though).


I did not create the fonts.

unifont was created by Roman Czyborra (czyborra.com).
I guess credit is supposed to be given to him when the fonts are used.

some text associated with etl-16:
"This distribution contains a subset of ISO 10646 (Unicode)
character set implemented as fixed-width bitmapped fonts,
supplied in Binary Distribution Format (BDF).  The fonts are
based on Naoto Takahashi's <Naoto.Takahashi@imag.fr> ETL font
collection, with Armenian and Georgian glyphs added by Mark
Leisher <mleisher@crl.nmsu.edu>.".

I put a little effort trying to find where I got some of the fonts so I could
offer at least some credit to the creators.


I appologize to anyone whose code/data was used and they were not properly
credited. please inform me of such.
