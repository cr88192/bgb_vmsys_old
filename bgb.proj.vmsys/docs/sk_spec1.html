<h1>BGB LANG/BGB</h1>
         
<pre><br>This spec will outline differences between scheme as defined by R5RS and SK.<br><br></pre>
         
<h2>Syntax</h2>
     My syntax is intended to be a useful comprimise between s-expressions
 and  a more conventional syntax. For the most part the lang/bgb syntax will 
map directly  to s-expressions. I have chosen not to introduce any new semantics
 through  the syntax, thus keeping the reader simple. <br>
    In this syntax every normal line is interpreted as a list:<br>
       
<pre>f x y =&gt; (f x y)<br><br></pre>
    Lower lines with a higher indentation are considered as sub-lists to
the   last line with a lower indentation:<br>
       
<pre>begin<br>	f x y <br>		f2 z<br>=&gt; (begin (f x y (f2 z)))<br></pre>
    I will define that tab will normally pad the indentation up to a multiple
  of 8 chars.<br>
    '\' may be used as a line continuation character, in which case the text
  found on the next immediate line is considered as part of the current line.<br>
       
<pre>f x y \<br>	z<br>=&gt; (f x y z)<br><br></pre>
    in this case indentation is considered as unimportant, however no blank 
 lines or comments are allowed on the next line.<br>
       
<pre>f x y \<br><br>	z<br><br></pre>
    Will be considered invalid.<br>
    '^' will be used to mark an object on a line to be an expression, rather
  than a list.<br>
       
<pre>^ x =&gt; x</pre>
    This is intended to allow arguments to be placed on lower lines with
relative   ease.<br>
    <br>
 Multiple objects may be placed after '^' in which case they will all be
submitted to the function:<br>
 
<pre>^ x y z =&gt; x y z</pre>
 <br>
    Expressions may be wrapped in parenthesis, which will indicate a manual 
 list.<br>
    This may be useful when it is not desired to code on a lower line, or 
to  avoid increasing nesting. All parenthesis are required to be matched, 
and  the normal indentation rules still apply.<br>
       
<pre>f (f<br>	f x)<br>=&gt; (f (f (f x)))<br><br></pre>
    Comments will be indicated using the c style // and /* */ notations.<br>
    /* and */ will be allowed to be nested.<br>
    [ and ] are intended to be an alternate syntax for lists, thus (f x y)
 and  [f x y] are considered analogous.<br>
    <br>
  idea: make a seperation between (...) and [...]. square brackets can be 
used for "soft lists", parens are processed directly however [...] =&gt; (list
...). also possible: soft vectors, #[...] becomes (vector ...).<br>
  {...}, block notation. a block is considered similar to an annonymous lambda.
 {...} =&gt; (lambda () ...)<br>
  <br>
  lists entered directly or vectors with the #(...) notation would be considered
 immutable...<br>
  <br>
  <br>
    A&nbsp;'dot notation' is also supported. This is detected while parsing 
 symbols, such that:<br>
       
<pre>a =&gt; a, a.b =&gt; (a 'b), a.b.c =&gt; ((a 'b) 'c), ...</pre>
    This can be used when referring to objects or namespaces, ie: self.name,
  root-env.system, ...<br>
    <br>
  Infix notation is also supported, names beginning with "!$%&amp;*+-/:&lt;+&gt;?^"
 will be allowed to be infix. If such a name is the second element in a list
 it will default to being put in functional position. '.' also has a special
 use here, period prefixing a normal symbol will allow it to be used infix,
 and '.' prefixing an infix name will indicate that it is a normal symbol.<br>
  <br>
  + 1 2 =&gt; (+ 1 2)<br>
  1 + 2 =&gt; (+ 1 2)<br>
  f 1 2 =&gt; (f 1 2)<br>
  1 .f 2 =&gt; (f 1 2)<br>
  f .+ x =&gt; (f + x)<br>
  <br>
    Otherwise it is syntactically similar to scheme syntax as defined in
R5RS.<br>
    <br>
         
<h2>Notations</h2>
     LANG/BGB will include keywords, these will be ordinary symbols with
the exception  that the last character is ':'. key:, a:, a-list:, ... are
keywords.<br>
    <br>
    Change: Make keywords match symbols with the same base? (equal? x: 'x)
 =&gt;  #t ?<br>
    This poses an issue of identity, if (equal? x: 'x) then how does one
differentiate   x: from 'x, ie: when such a distinction is needed. A possibility
is to have   keywords as symbols within boxes, and to look into the box for
comparison.   Given eq? and eqv? compare references, one can have equal?
look inside of   boxes...<br>
    Another possibility would be to have the distinction be made by match,
 thus:<br>
       
<pre>(equal? x: 'x) =&gt; #f<br>(match x: 'x) =&gt;&nbsp;!= #f (match returns either false or a numeric value...)<br></pre>
    This is presently open.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    #z is defined as a general nil value. this is used to indicate a logical
  response as being neither true or false, or a value as N/A. this is distinguished
  from the empty list, which is intended to serve as such...<br>
         
<h2>Semantics</h2>
     LANG/BGB will include dynamic variables.<br>
    Dynamic variables will be bound using defvar and letvar.<br>
    <br>
       
<pre>defvar var [value]</pre>
    Will define var as a dynamic var, and, if present, value will be bound
 to  var.<br>
    A dynamic var is required to be defined before it is referenced.<br>
    <br>
       
<pre>letvar ((var value)*) body</pre>
    This is similar to let, however it will bind values within the dynamic
 environment  rather than the lexical environment.<br>
    <br>
       
<pre>define var value</pre>
    This is similar to the scheme define, with the exception that at top
level   it will mask over rather than assign the previous definition (currently
has semantics of redefine).<br>
    <br>
       
<pre>redefine var value</pre>
    This is equivalent to the scheme define (not implemented). <br>
    <br>
   
<pre>rlet name ((var value)*)<br>	body...</pre>
  <br>
  this will be a renamed form of named let. the reason for this rename is 
that named let can be confusing when first seen.<br>
  <br>
    patterns will be similar to lambda lists, however they will also be allowed
  to contain literals and will allow argument currying.<br>
    <br>
       
<pre>function name (pattern)<br>	body...</pre>
    This will be the preferred means by which to define a function.<br>
    An implementation may allow multiple functions to share the same name 
and  differ in argument shape or structure. At present I will not define the
order  in which definitions will be searched, so it will be considered invalid
for  function definitions to overlap.<br>
    <br>
       
<pre>plambda (pattern)<br>	body...</pre>
    This will be similar to lambda, but will preserve pattern for later matching.
  I will not define if a plambda can be directly applied to arguments.<br>
    <br>
       
<pre>pattern closure</pre>
    This will extract the pattern from a closure defined by plambda (not
implemented).<br>
    <br>
       
<pre>match pattern arguments</pre>
    Will return a weight indicating how closely arguments matches pattern,
 or  #f in the case that pattern and arguments do not match.<br>
    Pattern matches will be based on whether both have the same general shape,
  and that literals are equal.<br>
   
<pre>eval form</pre>
   In normal cases I will define eval to work within the environment of a 
caller,  thus it may be used for defining new code within the caller.<br>
   
<pre>eval form env</pre>
   Evaluate form with the lexical environment given in env, and the present 
 dynamic environment.<br>
   <br>
   Environments are first class objects. I will define 'current-environment' 
 as being able to take a snapshot of the bindings in existance from where 
it is called.<br>
   
<pre>set! var value</pre>
   Set! will assign a value to a variable or expression. Conceptually though 
 set! will not distinguish between variables and expressions, a variable reference
 is considered as equivalent to a symbol identifying the variable, which
is  equivalent to an expression evaluating to a given location.<br>
   Expressions will have 2 return values: a reference to the returned object, 
 and a reference to the slot in which that value came from. These 2 values 
 will be referred to as 'ax' and 'rax' respectively.<br>
   Rax does not necissarily refer to a location though, and can not normally 
 be passed up through statements; it is only visible from direct returns. 
I will define that apply is to clear this value to #z, and it may be cleared 
 in other places as well.<br>
   Other systems had defined the concept of a setter, however that concept
 is not viewed as fundamental in this case. A setter will be viewed as a
function  which returns it's value in rax, and a getter returns it's value
in ax.<br>
   (bind-getter-setter getter setter) will create a function which when called 
 will invoke both functions on the given arguments, placing the getter in 
ax and the setter in rax. This will be one way in which to explicitly return 
 a value in rax.<br>
   <br>
   Locatives will be similar to typed, range checked pointers. Conceptually 
 a locative will contain: a lower extent, an upper extent, and a current reference.
 Normally: lower&lt;=reference&lt;upper. The type will indicate the type
of  data within the region referred to by this locative, and will be the
same  as that for vectors.<br>
   Locatives will also serve as handles for objects such as slots, and to 
allow  an alternate form of string manipulation (these are what will be returned 
 in rax).<br>
   <br>
  possible:<br>
  vec idx value;<br>
  obj slot value;<br>
  and, env var value; could possibly be removed.<br>
  <br>
   locative? obj<br>
   Returns #t if obj is a locative, #f otherwise.<br>
   <br>
   locative-&gt;integer locative<br>
   integer-&gt;locative integer<br>
   These will convert between integers and locatives. I will leave the nature 
 of these an implementation issue.<br>
   <br>
   set* locative value<br>
   Will assign value to the spot referred to by the current reference in
locative.<br>
   <br>
   contents locative<br>
   Will extract the value from the spot referred to by the locative's reference.<br>
   <br>
   locative-new lower upper type<br>
   Creates a new locative with the lower and upper bounds defined by lower
 and upper, and the type type. The reference in a locative is initially set
 to the lower bounds.<br>
   <br>
   locative-copy locative<br>
   Create a copy of the locative which may be modified independantly of the 
 previous copy.<br>
   <br>
   loc++ locative<br>
   loc-- locative<br>
   Step the direction of the locative, referring to next and previous elements 
 respectively.<br>
       
<h2>Patterns<br>
  </h2>
    A pattern is either a literal, a symbol, or a list (which in turn may 
contain  more patterns).<br>
    2 literals are to match if their values are equal (with the exception 
of  _:, which only requires the other to be a keyword).<br>
    A symbol will match any other type.<br>
    A&nbsp;list will match another list with the same length if all the members
  match between the lists.  
<h2> Environments<br>
  </h2>
   Environments will be first class objects in LANG/BGB. The environments 
will be  viewed as a stack of layers, with the outer layers being closer to
the "top  level" and the inner ones being increasingly closer to the current 
lexical  bindings.<br>
   During evaluation new layers are added on top and removed as execution 
winds  through the functions.<br>
   At any given point 'current-environment' can be called to make a snapshot 
 of the bindings in place at that time, the position and shape of the environment 
 is considered as static at that point (excluding changes later made to the 
 environment, which are not to effect things created using this env). Other 
 bindings may be added on top or at the current level, however only assignment 
 will be visible within this env (excluding assignment to bindings not in 
place within this env).<br>
   <br>
  At present I will define that environments will also preserve syntactic 
bindings.<br>
  <br>
   env 'sym<br>
   Refers to a binding within the env.<br>
   <br>
   env 'sym value<br>
   Assigns a value to the binding within the env.<br>
         
<h2>Objects</h2>
     I will use a prototype object system.<br>
    Objects will accept messages. An object has slots and handlers. A given 
 slot may hold a certain value.<br>
    Handlers will be defined using plambda and passed to objects. When an 
object  recieves a handler it will add it to it's list of handlers.<br>
    A message passed to an object will first be checked against the list
of  handlers, trying the closest match. Otherwise it will check if the message 
 refers to a slot, or contains a plambda.<br>
    <br>
    The general syntax for message passing will be:<br>
       
<pre>object message*</pre>
    <br>
    Objects will accept a few predefined messages:<br>
       
<pre>obj clone:</pre>
    This will clone the object and cause it to return a copy of itself.<br>
    <br>
       
<pre>obj get: slot</pre>
    Explicitly get a slot value.<br>
       
<pre>obj set: slot value</pre>
    Explicitly set a slot value.<br>
    <br>
    These are intended to allow more manual access to slots, these are capable
  of bypassing handlers if such functionality is needed.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
       
<pre>obj slot-name</pre>
    Will cause it to return the value associated with a given slot.<br>
       
<pre>obj slot-name value</pre>
    Will bind or assign value to the indicated slot.<br>
    <br>
    Worth noting is that it may not be possible to tell the difference between
  a slot and a message handler. This is not entirely bad as it allows transparent
  invokation of functions as slots, an example of which could be:<br>
       
<pre>define triangle (root-obj clone:)<br>triangle 'a 0<br>triangle 'b 0<br>triangle (plambda (c:) (sqrt (exp (self 'a) 2) (exp (self 'b) 2))</pre>
    For the convienience of defining objects there is the newobject macro:<br>
    <br>
       
<pre>newobject parent . patterns</pre>
    Parent is cloned, then each of the patterns is applied to the new object.<br>
    each has the form:<br>
       
<pre>(name value)		//the definition of object slots<br>((pattern...) body)	//the definition of object handlers</pre>
       
<pre><br></pre>
    This expands as:<br>
       
<pre>let ((obj (parent clone:)))<br>	(patterns)</pre>
    where:<br>
       
<pre>(name value) =&gt; (obj 'name value)<br>((pattern...) body) =&gt; (plambda (pattern...) body)</pre>
       
<pre><br></pre>
       
<h2>Macros</h2>
    Macros will be implemented in LANG/BGB. The idea is that a macro will 
take a piece  of code and perform some operation on it, and will return a 
new piece of code to be compiled in place of the macro call. it is also possible 
for macros  to return other macro definitions, in which case they are evaluated
 just the same as the original macro call.<br>
    define-syntax name func<br>
    Defines a macro which is bound to name. Func is a closure accepting a 
single  argument, the form it was invoked as.<br>
   <br>
    This is one use for currying, ex:<br>
    define-syntax add<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lambda ((_ a b)) `(+ ,a ,b)<br>
    add 2 3<br>
    <br>
    Where without currying it would be necessary to manually destructure
the   list.<br>
    <br>
    pattern-case key . forms...<br>
    Where each form is:<br>
    (pattern body)<br>
    <br>
    Matches key against each pattern in forms, and once a match is found, 
returns  the result of executing body.<br>
    If no match is found the result is undefined.<br>
    <br>
     
<pre>defmacro name (args)<br>	body...</pre>
   This is a shorthand for macro definition, it exists mostly for typing
convinience.<br>
   <br>
   ``(pattern...)<br>
   This is an alternative for quasiquote. ``(pattern...) expands as (doubleqq 
 (pattern...)), and differs from the main quasiquote in that it forms variable 
 renaming. At present this is done through hygenic variables, but later it 
 may automatically rename bound variables (at which time a syntax may be in
 place to cause capture). Hygenic variables are identified by symbols with
 the form 'name;', and the renaming will work by replacing such symbols with
 appropriate gensyms. Later occurances of the same symbol within the pattern
 will use the same gensym, however the symbols will not be valid outside
that  pattern.<br>
  problem: this is presently not sufficient to implement hygenic macros...<br>
   <br>
  possible new rule:<br>
  within the quotation symbols are altered to indicate they refer to a specific
 environment, which is passed along with the expanded code. new bindings
are  effectively renamed or bound within the passed environment.<br>
  syntax first sums up the bindings used within the quotation and generates
 an env with these bound (having been renamed to gensyms). hygenic symbols
 could be considered literals which escape the conversion (as normal symbols).<br>
  also: symbols could be replaced with objects which represent a binding
between  the actual object and the symbol name. the objects could differentiate
variable  and syntactic bindings, and could be handled during compilation.<br>
  they would be replaced by constant forms as appropriate, or be expanded 
in the case of syntax.<br>
  new binds are just renamed to gensyms.<br>
  <br>
   mini . opcodes...<br>
   This allows statements to be written within the SK "minicode", this can
 be viewed as a kind of high level assembler and is not intended to be used
 in general programs (as the nature of the minicode may change).<br>
   This makes use of ,, (doublemark) in order to allow inlining of statements.<br>
   During compilation the indicated minicode fragments will be substituted
 in place of the mini construct, and inlined expressions will be compiled
and substituted in place.<br>
   <br>
 
<h2>Threads/Messages</h2>
 begin-thread<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stuff...<br>
 Begin a thread which does stuff then terminates.<br>
 <br>
 thread thunk<br>
 Begin a thread which evaluates thunk then terminates.<br>
 <br>
 recieve-case (pattern handler)*<br>
 Recieves a message and dispatches it to the first handler in which the message 
matches pattern.<br>
 <br>
 recieve<br>
 Recieves a message and returns the value.<br>
 <br>
 pid args*<br>
 Sends a message to pid. the message is prepended with the sender's pid so 
that a response may be sent.<br>
 
<h2>Misc</h2>
  =, synonym for equal?<br>
 ==, synonym for eq?<br>
 !=, not equal?<br>
 !==, not eq?<br>
 :=, set!<br>
  more to be added.<br>
  <br>
  Possible Future<br>
  <br>
  Modules<br>
  <br>
  Modules will exist as environments with a controlled set of bindings.<br>
  During creation of a module a new binding layer will be created representing
 the new top level, all lower bindings will be left intact and will exist
as part of the lexical environment for defined closures.<br>
  When that form is returned from the layer will be stripped off and used 
as the top level of a new module.<br>
  <br>
  module<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; forms...<br>
  Will create a new annonymous module.<br>
  <br>
  defmodule location name<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; forms...<br>
  Will define a new module.<br>
  <br>
  import module<br>
  Import bindings from module and bind them in the present lexical env (likely
 using bindings which exist at compile time).<br>
  <br>
  also possible:<br>
  export vars...<br>
  or: export (modname var)...<br>
  <br>
  Create an annonymous module containing vars (second notation supporting 
renaming).<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  import module vars...<br>
  or: import module (var modname)...<br>
  Import a controlled set of vars with possible renaming.<br>
  <br>
  also:<br>
  with-import module (vars... | (var modname)...)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; body...<br>
  Similar, but imports only temporarily.<br>
  <br>
  these forms of import and export could be created using macros:<br>
  export vars... =&gt;<br>
  ``(let ((mod (empty-env))) (mod 'var var)... mod)<br>
  export (modname var)... =&gt;<br>
   ``(let ((mod (empty-env))) (mod 'modname var)... mod)<br>
  <br>
  import and with-import could expand to define's and let's respectively.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  misc: would need to preserve variable/syntax identity, possible: at present
 not allow import/export of syntax.<br>
  idea: generalized import could exist, however the module would need to
exist  at compile time. runtime importing could exist but be limited to a
finate  set of variables.<br>
         <br>
