BGF 0.3

Goals:
be simple to support in tools;
be reasonably flexible;
allow tools to work with only partial understanding of the data (this
does not require that everything in the model be used);
be generally adapted to a reasonable range of uses (such as basic models,
animated models, or worlds).

Syntax:

syntax will be based on s-expressions.

a symbol is a sequence of letters, numbers, or the characters
"!$%&*+-/:<=>?@_", and is required not to start with a number.
symbols will not be case sensitive.

numbers will start with a number or '-' followed by a number, I will define
decimal integer, hex integer ('0x' notation), and float (digits + '.' or
'e').

strings are enclosed in double quotes '"'. some escape sequences are
allowed: \" doublequote, \n newline, \\ backslash, ...

# will be used to escape special types or values:
#f #t #z, false, true, null.

vectors:
#(...) dimensions=1
#n(...) dimensions>1, where n is the arity:
	#2((1 0 0 0) (0 1 0 0) (0 0 1 0) (0 0 0 1))

; will indicate the start of a line comment.
#! and !# will be used for block comments.

there will also be lists, lists will be groups of objects enclosed in '('
and ')'.

at present other syntax will be reserved.

Notation:
I will write literal names in all caps, lower-case names will be variable.
'.' will indicate that the following variable is the rest of the list.
... will indicate the possible presence or more data/options.

definitions at higher levels of indentation will indicate what options are
possible with that type.

General Structure:
there will be a "top level" consisting of top-level bound objects.

the first element in a list will indicate the primative type, primatives
will be either built-in or may possibly be declared.
