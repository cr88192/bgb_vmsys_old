need slotted objects
implement ports as slotted objects

possibly implement slotted objects as vectors with entry 0 being a reference to a vector of slot names (again with slot 0 reserved). the vectors of slot names may not be modified as they may be shared, but they may be replaced.
clone will copy the values vector but leave the slot names alone. modification may effect both. possibly make the "slotted object" a wrapper for these vectors so that object identity is maintained after modification.
